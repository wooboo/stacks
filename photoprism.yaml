# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Windows / AMD64)
#
# Windows Pro users should disable the WSL 2 based engine in Docker Settings > General so that
# they can mount drives other than C:. This will enable Hyper-V, which Microsoft doesn't offer
# to its Windows Home customers. Docker Desktop uses dynamic memory allocation with WSL 2.
# It's important to explicitly increase the Docker memory limit to 4 GB or more when using Hyper-V.
# The default of 2 GB may reduce indexing performance and cause unexpected restarts.
#
# Documentation : https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/docker-compose/
# Docker Hub URL: https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism/
#
# Attention: When installing PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network,
# always run it behind a secure HTTPS reverse proxy like Traefik, Caddy, or NGINX.
# Your files and passwords will be transmitted in clear text otherwise.
